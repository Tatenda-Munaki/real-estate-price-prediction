# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction

Predict U.S. housing prices using multiple regression and advanced machine learning models.

## 🔹 Overview
This project builds a predictive model for housing prices based on property features and location.  
We evaluated multiple models and developed a dashboard for interactive price exploration.

## 🔹 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle U.S. Housing Dataset
- Size: 21,613 properties
- Features: price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, location, renovation year, etc.

## 🔹 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Ridge, Lasso
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Tableau for visualization
- Streamlit for deployment

## 🔹 Key Features
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visual insights
- Feature engineering for property age, geo-coordinates, and renovations
- Compared multiple models for best accuracy
- Interactive dashboard for price predictions

## 🔹 Results
- Best Model: **XGBoost**
- R² Score: **0.91**
- RMSE: **$52,000**
